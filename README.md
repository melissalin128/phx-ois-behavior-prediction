Predicting Suspect &amp; Officer Behaviors of Officer-Involved Phoenix Shootings (OIS) Using Police Video and Demographic Data

This project develops a deep learning model to predict suspect behavior (SP_BEHV) and police officer behavior (PO_BEHV) from individual frames of body camera video in police shooting incidents in Phoenix, Arizona, addressing the significant issue of police brutality. With a ResNet18 convolutional neural network, the model processes individual frames of body camera video, achieving a validation loss of 17.2098 at 10 epochs, a indication of moderate learning on a small sample of 18 samples. The approach leverages a carefully curated data set (usable\_df) from a total of 124 incidents, limited to fully labeled shootings. The results show that visual cues from body cam videos can partially predict behavior, even as the high loss reports did suggest challenges with sparse data and the nature of behavioral dynamics. Future advancements could include expanding the data set and incorporating temporal video analysis to motivate increased accuracy.

The project showcases the potential of deep learning to analyze police interactions, particularly in dangerous contexts like shootings, which are a public concern in Phoenix due to high levels of police violence. By restricting the model to only considering body camera footage, the model avoids reliance on demographic or contextual features and attempts to offer an unbiased visual analysis. The process entails rigorous data cleaning to ensure only authentic incidents with congruent video frames are utilized, overcoming problems like missing subfolders. Despite overfitting observed in validation loss, the consistent decrease in training loss (from 20.7620 to 11.7102) shows the model can learn relevant features. This study opens up the way for future research on automated behavior analysis in policing, and its implications reach as far as training and policy change.
